Map tool ideas. 

Cursor.  Just a normal cursor, more to turn off any active tools than anything. 
Trace pencil, when left click is held down, acts as the polygon tool but adds a vertex point every 1/4th of the cell size, letting go of the left mouse button pauses the adding points, letting the user make use of map drag when needed (and it will be needed) and as long as the tool does not change, pressing ad holding left button resumes the previous tracing activity until the user either connects to the start point, or they press Esc key, that removes that entire trace line. 

Prop config (floor items) in the rename room code, add a area where the player can set the items height that also uses a version of the Wall texture type code, basically it uses that art from the floor selection and makes a raised shape, keeping the art on top as a graphic.  Examples of usage is to make a bed on the floors graphic look like it's 3d and sitting on the floor, and not just a picture of a bed on the floor. 

Need to have multiple heights for this as how not everything is the same height.  Since walls are 4.5 tall, we could do half cell (tall) segments that the player can choose between. 

Also, need to update the code in layers panel, I think I accidentally got rid of the thumbnail on the item code.
